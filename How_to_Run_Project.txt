Project Title: Configuring and Securing a Network Infrastructure
Submitted by: Ayush Kumar Sharma

System Requirements
Operating System: Ubuntu/Linux (recommended), or use simulation tools for Cisco devices.

Tools Required:
iptables
curl
iftop
Netdata
Optional: Cisco Packet Tracer (for router simulation)
Privileges: Requires sudo access

Project Execution Steps
Step 1: Update System and Install Required Tools
sudo apt update && sudo apt install iptables curl iftop net-tools -y


Step 2: Simulate Router Configuration
Open router_config.txt

This file contains a sample Cisco router configuration:
IP addressing
NAT setup
OSPF routing
If using Cisco Packet Tracer:
Import this config into a router node
Observe routing and NAT functionality
If using a real router:
Connect via console and manually apply the commands


Step 3: Apply Firewall Rules (Linux iptables)
Open a terminal
Run the following commands:  sudo iptables -F        # Flush old rules
                             sudo iptables-restore < firewall_rules.txt       # Apply new rules


To verify:
Run in terminal:
sudo iptables -L -v
These rules:

Allow: SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), DNS (53)

Deny: All other inbound traffic

Log: Dropped packets

Step 4: Set Up Monitoring Tools
Run the script monitoring_setup.sh:

Run in terminal:
chmod +x monitoring_setup.sh
./monitoring_setup.sh


This installs: iftop → Real-time traffic monitor (CLI-based)

Netdata → Web-based live system and network monitor

Step 5: Use the Monitoring Tools
Netdata
Open your browser and go to: arduino
http://localhost:19999
iftop
Run in terminal: sudo iftop

Step 6: Test Network Security
Use another system or virtual machine to try accessing restricted ports (e.g., FTP, Telnet) on this machine.

Check if firewall logs those packets using:
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
