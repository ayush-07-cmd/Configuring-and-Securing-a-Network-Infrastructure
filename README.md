## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a secure and efficient network infrastructure using industry best practices. It involves designing a network diagram, configuring routers and firewalls, setting up monitoring tools, and implementing access control and encryption protocols to protect organizational assets from potential threats.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a secure and scalable network layout.
- Configure routers and firewalls with proper security policies.
- Implement VPN and IDS/IPS for enhanced protection.
- Monitor network performance and security incidents.
- Ensure the infrastructure is compliant with security standards.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- `iptables` – Linux firewall
- `Netdata` – Real-time system and network monitoring
- `iftop` – Command-line network bandwidth monitor
- Cisco Router (simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer)
- Bash scripting for automation
- Ubuntu/Linux (preferred environment)

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. Open `How_to_Run_Project.txt` for step-by-step instructions.
2. Apply firewall rules using `iptables`.
3. Simulate or apply the router configuration on a Cisco router or simulator.
4. Run `monitoring_setup.sh` to install monitoring tools.
5. View live data using Netdata or CLI with iftop.

## 📊 Results and Observations

- Firewall successfully blocked unauthorized traffic and logged intrusion attempts.
- VPN setup enabled encrypted remote access.
- Netdata provided real-time system metrics via web dashboard.
- The network diagram visually represents segmented and secured architecture.
- IDS/IPS detected simulated threats during testing phase.
